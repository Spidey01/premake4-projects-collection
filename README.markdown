Greetings monkey or fellow premake user.

This is a collection of project descriptions for [Premake4](http://industriousone.com/premake). You can always find the latest version on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Spidey01/premake4-projects-collection). Documentation will be found in the Wiki in that aforementioned GitHub.


Everything is laid out in it's own directory. Simpley copy the Premake4 and libXYZ directories into a suitable place and include libXYZ in your solution; where libXYZ is the dependency you want to use (e.g. sigc++).

  - Premake4/
    -  library code for the projects.
    - You may include this in your own stuff as well.

  - WhatEver/
    - Project file for libWhatEver.
    - Simply include or dofile it into your solution.

  - README
    - You just read it.
